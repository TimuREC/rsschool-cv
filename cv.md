## Summary
I worked in the Federal Tax Service Inspectorate for the city of Naberezhnye Chelny of the Republic of Tatarstan. In addition to my direct responsibilities, I was entrusted with the functions of a technologist: helping department employees with questions regarding the use of software, in case of problems with the use of software - analyzing the causes and describing the situation in which the problem occurs, in order to bring the problem to the developers. Also, when adding new functions to the software, I trained the department employees.
I studied programming on my own.
